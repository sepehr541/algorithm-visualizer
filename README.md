# Path Finding Algorithm Visualizer

Path Finding Algorithms are facinating to watch. Seeing the computer finds its way to the destination, avoiding the walls, and change its approach based on the algorithm chosen is not only fun, but also a great way to learn about searching in general. Search algorithms are critical to computer science and a visual comparision is a great way to see their differences.

This project uses React JS, ReactD&D, and lodash.

## Algorithms

- Dijkstra's
- Greedy Breadth First Search
- A*
- Depth First Search

## How to Use

You can interact with the website by selecting the algorith you want and clicking on "Run Algorithm" to start the visualization.

You can drag and drop both the source and the destination to any cell on the grid. You can also click and drag on empty cells to draw walls.

After the algorithm is finished it's animated run, you can drag the source or destination around
to see and on-the-fly visualization of the new positioning.

Use the reset button to remove all the walls and the painted cells. (i.e get a clear grid)

there is also a maze generator to generate a maze without drawing walls yourself.
